Chocolate Groove - FULL MOON Cacao Ecstatic Dance with Cacaoboy,"**CACAOBOY RETURNS...** Fresh from his South American tour, **Jesse Buck AKA Cacaoboy returns to Chocolate Groove** inspired & refreshed for a BIG SPRING INTO SUMMER! At the root of the Chocolate Groove is the “Ecstatic Dance” experience. An intentional, safe, all-inclusive, alcohol-free space where people intuitively move to music, release emotions, connect authentically, and tap into the joy of bold uninhibited self-expression. Yes, **we are NOT a traditional “Ecstatic Dance”**! Yet, we have grown into an ever evolving expression of a Community who love to dance, socialize, connect with each other, experience art & reinvent party culture. Merging the sacred & the play together with Cacao at the heart. In alignment with the **Scorpio “Flower Moon”** peaking on May 12th at 12:55am. We are going back to our roots.. **The intention** for this event is to co-create a fully immersive experience, with no barrier between DJ & Dancer. To create this experience we will be setting up the DJ in the center of the dance floor, with the NEW Unity Production Soundsystem (which was only used for the International Women's day event) in the 4 corners of the venue and run full surround sound. ✨✨ TICKETS - [https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/chocolate-groove-full-moon-cacao-ecstatic-dance-with-cacaoboy-tickets-1351195926389?aff=MEETUP](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/chocolate-groove-full-moon-cacao-ecstatic-dance-with-cacaoboy-tickets-1351195926389?aff=MEETUP) ✨**What to Expect:** **OPENING WARM UP -** The evening opens with a facilitated movement, breath and connection ice breaker workshop by Reva Wild. Exploring movement, community connection, play and intimacy. **CACAO CEREMONY -** Drop in, Connect & Open your Heart with our opening Cacao intention setting ceremony meditation. Indulge on what they call “the food of the gods”, Cacao AKA “the soul of chocolate”. Cacao, a heart-opening plant medicine, is shared to help deepen connection, amplify experience, boost mood, heart rate, and enhance movement. Its natural compounds gently energize the body and uplift the spirit, creating a euphoric, grounded state. We feel it is essential to take time to set intentions and unify the group before the dance journey begins. **ECSTATIC DANCE -** We’ll slowly sink into the floor & move into a **deep dive, Ecstatic Dance Journey.** Cacaoboy will be leading the ecstatic spaceship through various genres to invoke you into ecstatic states of expression. “Ecstatic” meaning “heightened feeling state”. From stillness we journey together without words, but through our movement we connect, to ourselves, each other and beyond. Co-creating a safe space for non-judgement, self expression, play & wonder. **SOUNDBATH MEDITATION -** Jesse Buck will be sharing a deep dive 432hz Crystal Bowl sound journey with special guests. With an array of other sound healing tools, you will sink into stillness and journey within through sacred sound. **CLOSING CIRCLE -** We end as we began, connected together in a circle. Let’s move. Let’s groove. Let’s rise — **together**. ✨**PLEASE NOTE -** Our bar will have refreshments & food for participants to stay hydrated & nourished! The dance floor will be a no phone, no talking space, but we will have a lounge on the stage for those who want to rest and connect with words.
